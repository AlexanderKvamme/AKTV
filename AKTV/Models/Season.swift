Frasier tells his family and Roz about his upcoming move, following a misunderstanding that leads them to believe he is dying.  He promises to visit frequently.  Frasier makes a speech to the group, and again on his final show at KACL, about the importance of taking chances.  His seatmate on the plane thanks him for the stimulating conversation as their plane finally lands...in Chicago.",
